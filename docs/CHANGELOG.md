## [4.1.0] — 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- Add `-XstartOnFirstThread` for macOS M1 — LWJGL/GLFW was crashing on launch with `ExceptionInInitializerError`
- Wire `instance.java_arguments` into `build_jvm_args` — custom JVM args set in the UI were being silently ignored
- Fix mod list cache: replace `dir_mtime` comparison with `file_count` to avoid stale cache on macOS where directory mtime may not update when .jar files are added

## [4.0.3] — 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- Remove 30s total request timeout from HTTP_CLIENT which killed large modpack/JAR downloads exceeding 30 seconds (#1)
- Forward cancel flag to retry loop so mid-download cancellation actually works (#2)
- Replace stale one-time cancel snapshot with dynamic AtomicBool check through the full download lifecycle (#3)
- Fix race condition between kill_game and game launch that could orphan a spawned child process (#4)
- Remove phantom `instanceId` parameter sent from TypeScript to parameterless Rust `kill_game` (#5)
- Replace `.unwrap()` on semaphore acquire with proper error propagation in modpack.rs and launcher.rs (#6)
- Replace `.unwrap()` on JSON serialization with `?` propagation in launcher.rs (#7)
- Use `CANCELLED_SENTINEL` constant instead of hardcoded `"Cancelled"` string in cloud.rs (#8)
- Log warning for panicked download tasks instead of silent discard (#9)
- Add `console.warn` fallback when RAM prefetch fails instead of empty `catch {}` (#10)
